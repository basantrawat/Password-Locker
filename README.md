# Password Locker
Password Locker is a flask app which helps you to keep your account details safe, secure, and accessible.  
Password Locker does an amazing job of storing your account information.


## Password Security

For Password Security we have used cipher encryption, and on top of it we have added a salt to it. Salting makes your password more secure from being hacked & cracked by someone.

DataBase details are not shared in this GitHub Repo, so that you will have to make by yourself only.
