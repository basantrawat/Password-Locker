# Password Locker
Password Locker is a flask app which helps you to keep your account details safe, secure, and accessible.  
Password Locker does an amazing job of storing your account information.


## Password Security

For Password Security we have used cipher encryption, and on top of it we have added a salt to it. Salting makes your password more secure from being hacked & cracked by someone.

## Database
Database file is not included in this GitHub repo, so you will have to create it by yourself.   
   
DB_Name - "passlocker"    

Table_Name - "accountdetails" (sno(int),site(varchar),username(varchar),password(varchar(1000)),date(timestamp))
